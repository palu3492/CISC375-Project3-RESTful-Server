                <li>The most recent violent crime that occured near the University of St. Thomas was a burglary that
                    happened on Summit Ave.</li>
                <li>In the past 5 years, the majority of robberies happened in Capitol River.</li>
                <li>Over the last 2 years, almost all cocaine and heroin was sold in the Payne/Phalen area</li>
                <li>Over the last year, Capitol River has experienced 7x the number of incidents that occurred in some other neighborhoods.</li>
                <li>In May of 2019, Summit Hill had only 30 property crimes, which is quite low compared to other neighborhoods.</li>
