Dynamic Web Application (60 pts)

Implement the following to earn 45/60 points (grade: C)

Show a map using the Leaflet API  <-- DONE
    Pan and zoom available with mouse click-and-drag and scroll wheel interaction
        Limit pan and zoom so map does not display regions outside of St. Paul
        HINT: zoom levels 11-18 are good
    Have an input box for a user to type a location (lat/long coordinates, address, etc.)
        Map should update when location is entered
        Input box text should update with new location (lat/long coordinates or address) when map is panned
        Clamp input values if lat/long is outside of St. Paul's bounding box
Retrieve data from your St. Paul Crime API
    By default, include crimes from 10/01/2019 to 10/31/2019
    Populate a table with one row per crime (use neighborhood_name rather than neighborhood_number, and incident_type rather than code)
        Only show crimes that occurred in locations visible on the map
        HINT: get lat/long coordinates for the NW and SE corners of the map to use as the min/max lat/long coordinates.
    Draw markers on the map for each neighboorhood
        Marker should include number of crimes committed in that neighborhood
    Use the Nominatim API (https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/ (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)) to convert between address and lat/long
