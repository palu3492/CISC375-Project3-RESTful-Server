Rubric:
Populate a table with one row per crime (use neighborhood_name rather than neighborhood_number, and incident_type rather than code)
        Only show crimes that occurred in locations visible on the map
        HINT: get lat/long coordinates for the NW and SE corners of the map to use as the min/max lat/long coordinates.
Draw markers on the map for each neighboorhood
    Marker should include number of crimes committed in that neighborhood

What to do:
Figure out what neighborhoods are visible on the map then call our api to retrieve all incidents that happened in that neighborhood.
Then count the incidents in each neighborhood.
